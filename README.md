# ðŸ¤– Mlembot â€” AI-Powered Discord Summarizer Bot

A Discord bot that summarizes articles, YouTube videos, and answers questions using DeepSeek and OpenAI.

It utilizes a DeepSeek API for summarization due to its lower token cost and OpenAI for questions, however you can change these to whatever models you'd like :)

Note: This bot was made mostly with ChatGPT and Cursor as a test to see if it could produce working code
